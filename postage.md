# Postage

We occasionally have to courier important documents
from one country to another
given our remote-first approach and the regulatory
world's 'less than remote or digital' approaches.

Needed a place to collect the couriers we use for future reference.

## Sender in Portugal

### Recipient in the Portugal
So far, we have only used the Portuguese national mail, [CTT](https://www.ctt.pt/)
to deliver things internally.

We did have one urgent courier delivery to arrange and we used DHL (see below)
due to a lack of other online booking options, but more should be researched.

### Recipient is International
When sending packages internationally, there are a number of options:
+ The national postal service, [CTT](https://www.ctt.pt/empresas/encomendas-e-correio/enviar/regras-e-cuidados-para-envios/envios-internacionais) - last
we checked, they were much more expensive than competitors for
international deliveries and there were multiple weight limitations
+ [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/en-pt/home.html) - Usually also very expensive
+ [GLS](https://gls-group.eu/PT/pt/home)
+ [DHL](https://www.dhl.pt/)

We found a couple of others, but they were almost impossible to book online.

#### DHL
We have only chosen to use **DHL Express** to date because we have needed to
send documents during the pandemic and this service was the only one offering
courier collection from our location when all 'parcel shops' were closed.

According to [their website](https://www.logistics.dhl/pt-pt/home/obter-um-orcamento.html),
sending non-express packages through DHL can only be done by contacting them
or having a commercial account already established.

To use **DHL Express** however, all you need to do is go to the following URL:
https://mydhl.express.dhl/pt/pt/shipment.html#/rate-and-quote
And follow the booking instructions - you will be able to book collection dates
and time windows as part of the process.


## Sender in the UK

### Recipient in the UK
In the past we have used [Interparcel](https://uk.interparcel.com/) for this,
both cheaply and successfully.  
It's worth researching the international options given here too though, as
they also work well nationally in most cases.


### Recipient is International
When sending parcels internationally, we have used two different websites that
aggregate a number of courier partners:
+ https://www.parcelmonkey.co.uk/
+ https://www.parcel2go.com/

Depending on package sizes and weights, the best option varies from one to the
other, but we have used both successfully in the past.

***NOTE:*** _It is key that the parcels are very well padded as in our
experience, there is little care taken with them over long distances_.
